This tool can fix most problems caused unable to open the game by the savefiles. (which is the game will only launch if you move the savefiles to other folders)

## Installation

You need to install at least [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run this program.  
Or just download the [release](https://github.com/WEGFan/Geometry-Dash-Savefile-Fix/releases) for Windows (requires at least Windows 7 with Service Pack 1) so you don't need to install Python.
